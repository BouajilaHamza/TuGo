## Project Overview
TuGo is a mobile app built using Flutter, MongoDB, and FastAPI. It allows users to:
- Check real-time bus and train schedules.
- Report delays, crowded vehicles, and other issues.
- Share tips and experiences with fellow commuters.

## Tech Stack
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform framework for building beautiful UIs.
- **MongoDB**: Scalable NoSQL database for storing transport data.
- **FastAPI**: Fast, asynchronous Python framework for building APIs.

## Getting Started
